# Calendar
Generates single page yearly calendar and store them in pdf format.
Single Page Yearly Calendar: Idea is to represent calendar for entire year in a single page pdf. 

Input:
start_year --> The year from which calendar needs to be generated
end_year --> The year until which calendar needs to be generated 

Description:
It generates all calendar for years between start_year and end_year (both inclusive). The calendar for each year will be in a separate pages of a pdf file. 

In case single page calendar (of a specific year) is needed then start_year and end_year should be same.

Limitation:
1) It works for only AD calendar years
